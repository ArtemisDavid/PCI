subtitle: "A Machine Learning Framework to Predict Policy Changes in China"

&nbsp;

We developed a machine learning algorithm to "read" the *People's Daily* --- the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China --- and predict changes in China's policy priorities. The output of this algorithm, which we call the Policy Change Index (PCI) of China, turns out to be a leading indicator of major policy changes since 1951. The nearby figure plots the PCI against the ground truth of China's policy changes. The PCI often spikes months before the actual policy changes take place, validating the index's predictive power.
